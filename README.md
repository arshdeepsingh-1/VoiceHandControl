I'm excited to share my latest creation, VolumeHandControl! This revolutionary innovation allows you to change the volume of your computer using simple hand motions. Built with the powerful libraries cv2, Mediapipe, numpy, ctypes, comtypes, and pycaw, it provides a smooth and easy way to manipulate audio levels without using a keyboard or mouse. I'm looking forward to discovering new applications and upgrades!
